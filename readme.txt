README

The Dota Timer is a program designed to monitor time-based events that take place during a 
game of Dota, and notify the user of their occurrence.  More specifically, the Dota Timer 
will track and notify users of rune spawns, which occur at two minute intervals; the 
duration of Aegis of the Immortal, which lasts for six minutes; and Roshan’s respawn timer, 
which lasts ten minutes.

The user will have the option of receiving visual and/or auditory notifications of the 
events’ occurrence.  Settings will be included to allow users to choose whether or not to 
enable auditory or visual cues, and to set the starting count on the timer.  The 
application will allow for pausing to match in-game pauses.  There will also be a method of 
adjusting the timer for cases when the application’s timer has desynchronized from the 
in-game timer.

The main goal of the application is to create a timer that provides useful information to 
the player, while minimizing the amount of attention the user needs to give to the 
application in order to run it normally.
